 Morse Code Overview
 
### What is Morse Code?
 
Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes (or dits and dahs). It is used for transmitting messages over long distances, especially where voice communication is impractical.

### Historical Context :

Morse code was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s for use with telegraph systems. It revolutionized long-distance communication, allowing messages to be sent electrically over wires, replacing slower and less reliable methods.

 ### How Morse Code Works

Morse code assigns a unique combination of dots and dashes to each letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. Here’s how the system operates:

- Dots (·): Represent a short signal, typically one unit of time.
- Dashes (–) : Represent a longer signal, typically three units of time.

The duration of a dot is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code. The timing relationship between dots and dashes determines the distinction between different characters. Spaces between parts of the same letter are indicated by one dot duration, spaces between letters by three dot durations, and spaces between words by seven dot durations.

 ### Example:

- A: ·–
- B: –···
- C: –·–·
- D: –··

These sequences allow any text to be encoded and transmitted using Morse code.

### Using Morse Code

Morse code can be transmitted in various ways, including:

- Visual Signaling : Using flashing lights or semaphore.
- Auditory Signaling : Using sound signals, such as clicks or tones.
- Radio Transmission : Morse code was extensively used in early radio communication and is still used in some forms of amateur radio and aviation.
